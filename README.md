This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) / Typesafe [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Why ?

While CT3A is great it presents unecessary complexity and boilerplate for small projects or opinionated developers; this template offers a simpler and fully customisable starting point for any project giving you more control over your application architecture while allowing you to tailor the stack to your exact needs without being constrained by pre-configured defaults. So, why Prisma ? Fully type-safe! and why NextAuth.js ? More comprehensive feature set than Lucia, More flexible than Auth0 and Clerk!

## Getting Started

First, click on use template on this repository and clone it in your PC.

Secondly, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this template is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Create T3 App deployment documentation](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel) for more details.
